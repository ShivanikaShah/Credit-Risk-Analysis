# Credit-Risk-Analysis
Given information of approximately 50,000 credit cards with 50 variables, the data includes information 
from the application to the credit card in Brazil during 2007, some of which can be used to predict 
the performance of the loan.

•	Constructed a scorecard which can model the probability of default for the credit card
applications. 
•	Created a Logistic Regression, XGBoosting and Random Forest model that predicts whether the person is at default or not.
